# Great task for Great Fullstack Developer

This app is based on symfony skeleton app.

More information about it you can find here: https://github.com/symfony/symfony-standard

While I was developing design of our app I realized how to build pages with ReactJS
(my repository with reactjs code you can find here: )
but it just would take more time for me to refresh my React knowledge, so I decided 
to use Twig and CSS.
